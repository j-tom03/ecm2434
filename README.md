# ECM2434
## Gamification of Sustainability

Welcome to the repo for Group 404: Group not found's ECM 2434 coursework on the Gameification of Sustainability.

I think there are requirements for all this stuff to be done properly, therefore:
- [Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
- [Branching](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) etc etc

Current split of responsibilities:
- Frontend: Ross, Tom
- Backend: James, Matthew
- Documentation: Emily
- Unassigned: Lewis

The above should be updated as necessary should people switch between areas.
